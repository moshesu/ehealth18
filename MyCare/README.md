TAU e-Health workshop

MyCare is an app that can help you coordinate all of your or your loved ones' care needs. 
Our app keeps information secure and up-to-date, keeps track of location and heartbeat, 
and also provides alerts to caretakers, friends, and family. MyCare manages and organizes 
all the information about the Caretakers and the Patients, which is then safely secured 
in Azure.





Microsoft Band & MyCare app is a solution that addresses the day-to-day 
supervision needed to allow seniors to stay in their own homes. You always get the needed 
support from the specialized team. Now the help is just a click away.
